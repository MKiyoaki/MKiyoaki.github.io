\p{I am an MPhil student in \em{Advanced Computer Science} at the [University of Cambridge](ucam), studying
with
Previously I was also a Research Intern at
[Shanghai AI Laboratory](shailab), focusing on AI reasoning and LLM post-training with formal languages.
I obtained my undergraduate degree of \em{Computer Science} from [King's College London](kcl).
I am also an alumni of [Google DeepMind Education Programme](https://deepmind.google/about/education/).

\p{My interests lie at the intersection of \strong{Mechanistic Interpretability} and \strong{Causal Inference}.
My primary research goal is to open the black box of Large Language Models (LLMs) to build verifiable and trustworthy AI.
To this end, I specialize in developing counterfactual diagnosis methods and reinforcement-learning based post-training algorithms,
aiming to both dissect the internal mechanisms and enhance the robust reasoning capabilities of AI models.

\p{As part of a collaboration with researchers from [King's College London](kcl) & [Imperial College London](ic),
I am also exploring the application of explainable AI (XAI) in real-world medical imaging diagnostics.}
