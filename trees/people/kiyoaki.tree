\p{I am an MPhil student in \em{Advanced Computer Science} at the [University of Cambridge](ucam). Currently I am also a Research Intern at
[Shanghai AI Laboratory](shailab), focusing on AI reasoning and LLM post-training.
I obtained my undergraduate degree of \em{Computer Science} from [King's College London](kcl).
I am also an alumni of [Google DeepMind Education Programme](https://deepmind.google/about/education/).

\p{My interests
are centered around Machine Learning and Artificial Intelligence technologies. My primary research goal is to develop verifiable and trustworthy AI for complex reasoning and decision-making.
To this end, I specialize in \strong{Neuro-Symbolic} methods, \strong{Deep Reinforcement Learning} and the
\strong{Post-training} technologies of Large Language Models (LLMs).
I am particularly passionate about applying these techniques in real-world scenarios, including building
autonomous, effective and reliable \strong{Embodied AI/Robotic} systems.}

\p{As part of a collaboration with researchers from [King's College London](kcl) & [Imperial College London](ic),
I am also exploring the application of explainable AI (XAI) in real-world medical imaging diagnostics.}
