\p{I am an MPhil student in \em{Advanced Computer Science} at the [University of Cambridge](ucam) and a
Research Intern in [Shanghai AI Lab](shailab), focusing on AI reasoning and LLM post-training.
I obtained my undergraduate degree of \em{Computer Science} from [King's College London](kcl).
I am also an alumni of [Google DeepMind Education Programme](https://deepmind.google/about/education/).

\p{My primary research goal is to develop verifiable and trustworthy AI for complex reasoning and decision-making.
To this end, I specialize in \strong{Neuro-Symbolic} methods and Reinforcement Learning.
I am particularly passionate about applying these techniques in real-world scenarios, including building
safe and reliable \strong{Embodied AI and Robotic} systems.}

\p{As part of a collaboration with researchers from the
[Smart Medical Imaging CDT at King's College London & Imperial College London](smicdt),
I am also exploring the application of explainable AI (XAI) in real-world medical diagnostics.}
